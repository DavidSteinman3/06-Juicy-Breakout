# 06-Juicy-Breakout

Project 6 for my C220 class at Indiana University Bloomington. I was provided with a simple brick breaker game built in Godot and then I implimented some of the "juicy" features that were demonstrated in the 2012 GDC presentation, "Juice it or Lose it."

What I changed:
1.	The color of paddle, tiles, and ball
2.	The tiles and paddle tween in now. Each block will tween in independently.
3.	Squeeze and stretch paddle
4.	Wobble the ball after it hits something
5.	Change the color of the ball after it hits something
6.	Shake the ball when the ball hits something
7.	The blocks rotate as they are hit
8.	The blocks fall off the screen when they are hit
9.	The blocks become slowly transparent after being hit
10.	Shake blocks when ball hits paddle
11.	Add screen shake when the ball hits something
12.	Sound effects when the ball hits the paddle, blocks, or wall (It's all my dog, when the game is played it sounds like him when I take him for a car ride.) 
13.	Add music
14.	Changed background color/ Background color changes every .8 seconds
15.	Rotate/spin the ball
16.	Particles emit when ball hits the paddle
